# frida-qml

Frida QML plugin for Qt >= 5.15.

## Binaries

Grab one from Frida's [releases][], and extract it in your Qt installation's
`qml` directory.

## Building: standalone

First, download a frida-core devkit from Frida's [releases][], and extract it to
e.g. `/opt/frida-core-devkit`. Then:

    $ mkdir build-frida-qml
    $ cd build-frida-qml
    $ qmake FRIDA_CORE_DEVKIT=/opt/frida-core-devkit ../frida-qml
    $ make -j16
    $ make install

## Building: together with Frida

E.g. on macOS/x86_64:

    $ make core-macos-thin
    $ cd build/tmp_thin-macos-x86_64
    $ mkdir frida-qml
    $ cd frida-qml
    $ qmake ../../../frida-qml
    $ make -j16
    $ make install
